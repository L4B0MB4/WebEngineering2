          <h5>Fair Information Practices</h5>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
          played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
          Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal
          information. In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data
          breach occur: <br />
          We will notify you via email
          <ul>
            <li>Within 1 business day</li>
          </ul>
          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
          rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
          have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
          investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
