              <Card.Description>
                In this case the title says it all: You can't spell Blockchain without Lars Bommersbach. The two time NFL MVP and leading
                hammer throw world record holder changed the whole business world with his new and completely different, decentralized
                finance and transaction mechanism. Because this is not enough he founded golddigger.io and while ruining every world-leading
                global bank he is also changing the game of Social Media right now. Thanks to this man the future looks bright. Oh, and just
                in case you are attempting to steal his loved motorcycle: Don't attempt it unless you can hack RSA encryption.

              <Card.Description>
                Isabel was already one of the biggest players in IT business when everything started in the Silicon Valley in 1951. The fact
                that you can't tell her age by her looks (compared to her old friend and apprentice Bill Gates) says everything about her
                Makeup skills. Because of her passion for gold chains, shoes, teeth and even golden food everyone who was involved in the
                deal knew that she would be the right one to finally make golddigger.io unique.

              <Card.Description>
                Even though Tino just joint the golddigger.io association on 4/20 you can already see his massive impact on the unique and
                revolutionary frontend design and also the user count. Because he has connections to Greenhouse people from all over the
                world he was able to create a massive fanbase for this organization. So whenever you dig some gold here just remember that
                this OG mbzy made all of this possible.
